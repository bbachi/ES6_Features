## Constants

*Support for immutable varibales i.e which cannot be re-assigned new content. This only makes only Varibale itself immutable not the content itself*

```
  const name = "github"
  name = "node" // this will give you compile error
  
  const person = {}
  person.firstName = "firstNAME" //this will not

```
